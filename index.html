                Protein structure prediction is the inference of the 
                three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino 
                acid sequence—that is, the prediction of its secondary 
                and tertiary structure from primary structure. Structure prediction 
                is different from the inverse problem of protein design. Protein
                structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued
                by computational biology; and it is important in medicine 
                (for example, in drug design) and biotechnology 
                (for example, in the design of novel enzymes).S
