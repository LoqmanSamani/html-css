Yeah, nigga

I'm still fucking with you

Still waters run deep

Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga

Guess who's back?

Still, doing that shit Andre?

(Oh for sho', check me out)

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga

Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot

'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock

You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block

Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off

How nigga? My last album was The Chronic (Nigga)

They want to know if he still got it

They say rap's changed

They wanna know how I feel about it

(If you ain't up on thangs)

Dr. Dre is the name

I'm ahead of my game

Still puffing my leafs
