            Look
            If you had
            One shot
            Or one opportunity
            To seize everything you ever wanted
            In one moment
            Would you capture it
            Or just let it slip?
            
            Yo
            His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
            There’s vomit on his sweater already, mom’s spaghetti
            He’s nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
            To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin’
            What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
            He opens his mouth, but the words won’t come out
            He’s chokin’, how, everybody’s jokin’ now
            The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
            Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
            Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
            He’s so mad, but he won’t give up that easy? No
            He won’t have it, he knows his whole back’s to these ropes
            It don’t matter, he’s dope, he knows that, but he’s broke
            He’s so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that’s when it’s
            Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
            Better go capture this moment and hope it don’t pass him
            ...

            Yeah, nigga
I'm still fucking with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back?
Still, doing that shit Andre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang

You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh

[Refrain: Eminem & Dina Rae]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl
